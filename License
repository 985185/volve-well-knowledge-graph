## Fix 2: Remove `wells/` and `archive/` from GitHub (recommended)
On GitHub, delete the folders if they’re already uploaded:

- Delete `wells/` (generated outputs)
- Delete `archive/` (dev history / big files)

You already have:
- `examples/15_9-F-12_manifest.md` for a sample — that’s enough.

## Fix 3: Update CITATION.cff URL
Your `CITATION.cff` should point to this repo:

`https://github.com/985185/volve-well-knowledge-graph`

After you do those three, the repo will look professional and intentional instead of “worked on in a panic at 8pm”.

If you paste the current `CITATION.cff` contents here, I’ll give you the full corrected file to paste in one shot.
